							### Some concepts to keep in mind

							| | |
							| ------------- | ------------- |
							| History    | A record. |
							| Lineage    | Line of descent from an ancestor. |
							| Provenance | Place or source of origin. |

						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							Every human and/or automated process should
							concerned with:

							- Recording the history of each change to our code
							base and data sources
							- Recoding the lineage of every each asset we
							produce
							- Making it easy to trace the provenance of our
							assets

						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							Behave like:

							- You may have to recreate all assets from scratch; or
							- You may get auditted at any second
							    - by clients
							    - by you future self/co-worker
							    - by your boss
							    - by the government

							We often want to look back at work as it was at a
							specific point in time.

							The more messages/metadata we associate with each
							small unit of work the easier it will be to
							understand in the future.

							Will I really need to look back in time?

							YES! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

							Notes and metadata will help when trying to: <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

							- understand complicated or abstrusely written code.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
							- the intention of code, even when it may actually be broken.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
							- ... <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

							#### How git helps?

							Every _commit_ to the git repo can have a short
							message and a long description associated with it.

							Think of them as notes to you future self or
							future co-workers.

							For example:

							A comment by a project a collaborator:

							_*This looks cool as hell; could you add a comment
							explaining what this is doing?*_

							Caused me to rework the code and commit it with:

							<pre><code class="shell">
							commit abc2d8532489b173e0428feae40cf0f11dbf7cad
							Author: Tom Marks
							Date:   Sat May 26 07:13:53 2018 -0400

								Attempts to make clever code more readable

							</code></pre>
						</textarea>

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>

							It's not a great commit message.

							But hopefully contains the motivation for the
							code changes.

						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							Linus Torvald, the creator of git, has much higher
							standards for a git commit message:

							<pre><code class="shell" style="font-size: 50%; line-height: 150%;">
							A good commit message looks like this:

								Header line: explaining the commit in one line

								Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
								in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
								being fixed, etc etc.

								The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
								please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
								74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
								nicely even when it's indented.

								Reported-by: whoever-reported-it
								Signed-off-by: Your Name <youremail@yourhost.com>

							where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
							just one line.  That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
							shortlog, and should summarize the change in one readable line of text,
							independently of the longer explanation.

							## Why Lineage?

							Producing any useful asset often requires using multiple code bases, complex infrastructure,
							and numerous data sources.

					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>

							If, in the future, we want to have any hope of explaining how
							the asset was produced we will want to record as much of this as possible

						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>

							Just think about all the inputs that are brought together to produce a ML model.

							We don't know when or why we might need to trace the origins of an asset
							be it code in production or a model & the training data which made a prediction.

							The only thing we can be sure is that one day someone will ask us. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

							So the best advice is <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
